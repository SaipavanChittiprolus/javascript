/* learning these type of content is very interesting compared to other youtube videos this feels very new 
*first i learned about the varible like 
1.const
2.let 
* then the data types 
1.number
2.string
3.bigint 
4.boolean
5.symbol
6.undefined 
7.null //object 
* type converstions 
1.Numbers 
there are some drawbacks in js to convert the inputs 
they convert everything without checking them  
if the 1 is converted it is true // if 0 it is false 
if string is empty it is false // if it has content it is true
